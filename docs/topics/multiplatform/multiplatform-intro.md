[//]: # (title: Introduction to Kotlin Multiplatform)

Support for multiplatform programming is one of Kotlin's key benefits. It reduces time spent writing and maintaining the
same code for [different platforms](multiplatform-dsl-reference.md#targets) while retaining the flexibility and benefits of native programming.

## Code sharing between platforms

Kotlin Multiplatform allows you to maintain a single codebase of the application logic for [different platforms](multiplatform-dsl-reference.md#targets).
You also get advantages of native programming, including great performance and full access to platform SDKs.

Kotlin provides the following code sharing mechanisms:

* Share common code among [all platforms](multiplatform-share-on-platforms.md#share-code-on-all-platforms) used in your project.
* Share code among [some platforms](multiplatform-share-on-platforms.md#share-code-on-similar-platforms) included in your project to reuse much of the code in similar platforms:

* If you need to access platform-specific APIs from the shared code, use the Kotlin mechanism of [expected and actual declarations](multiplatform-expect-actual.md).
* Explore [sharing code principles and examples](multiplatform-share-on-platforms.md) if you want to create applications or libraries targeting other platforms

Once you have gained some experience with Kotlin Multiplatform and want to know how to solve particular cross-platform development tasks:

* [Share code on platforms](multiplatform-share-on-platforms.md) in your Kotlin Multiplatform project.
* [Set up targets manually](multiplatform-set-up-targets.md) for your Kotlin Multiplatform project.
* [Add dependencies](multiplatform-add-dependencies.md) on the standard, test, or another kotlinx library.
* [Configure compilations](multiplatform-configure-compilations.md) for production and test purposes in your project.
* [Publish a multiplatform library](multiplatform-publish-lib.md) to the Maven repository.
* [Build native binaries](multiplatform-build-native-binaries.md) as executables or shared libraries, like universal frameworks or XCFrameworks.

### Android and iOS applications

Sharing code between mobile platforms is a major Kotlin Multiplatform use case. With Kotlin Multiplatform,
you can build cross-platform mobile applications that share code between Android and iOS projects to implement networking,
data storage and data validation, analytics, computations, and other application logic.

### Multiplatform libraries

Kotlin Multiplatform is also helpful for library authors. You can create a multiplatform library with common code and its
platform-specific implementations for JVM, web, and native platforms. Once published, a multiplatform library can be used
as a dependency in other cross-platform projects.

See the [Publish a multiplatform library](multiplatform-publish-lib.md) for more details.
